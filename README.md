## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

The most obvious thing I learned first was that even a simple component at first glance may look easy and not challenging.
Then in middle of workflow it becames obvious that there are some tricky elements that require that extra attention in order to code all the details well.
Second thought was that a good study of the design that was provided is a must to work fast and effectively while coding. Changes in middle of a workflow are a burden and require extra effort which could be saved by preparing well beforehand.

### Continued development

My focus for a few next months is still performing the Frontend Mentor challenges, because that is the base of my experience building process.
At the same time I am learning from JavaScript course to prepare properly for a framework.

Things to learn for now are:

- JS course needs to be finished - 14 of 42 chapters done
- 10 Frontend Mentor Newbie challenges to enter the Junior level
- Git pull and clone / OpenSource for working in group experience

### Useful resources

- [CSS speech bubbles](https://codingislove.com/css-speech-bubbles/) - This helped me because I had no idea how to create a triangle on any side I want.
- [Image Crop](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-crop-an-image-in-css) - This article allowed me to understand and use the image cropping to finish the taks.
